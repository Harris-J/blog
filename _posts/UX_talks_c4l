## UX as the sum of all interactions

The touch point theory of interactions. Since there is a fair bit of emotion and subjectivity frameworks are used.

Used a performance such as a play. Front stage, backstage, behind the scenes.

A customer journey map, is the fronstage
A service blueprint looks at the backstage & behind
