# User Experience
### may 25, Celine
Going to merge

## UX as the sum of all interactions

The touch point theory of interactions. Since there is a fair bit of emotion and subjectivity frameworks are used.

Used a performance such as a play. Front stage, backstage, behind the scenes.

A customer journey map, is the fronstage
A service blueprint looks at the backstage & behind

### Focus group design sprint
Goal: Create the fewest solutions to the most problems

Questions:

- wat would htis Experience look like if everytouch point was positive.
- What needs to change for this to happen
- What supports would you need as staff for this to happen
